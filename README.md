# The Golem SDK documentation

## What is Golem?

{% hint style="info" %}
Golem is a global, open source decentralized supercomputer that anyone can use. It is made up of the combination power of the users' machines, from PCs to entire data centers.
{% endhint %}

Under the hood Golem is a decentralized marketplace where IT resources such as computation hardware are bought and sold. The decentralized network actors have two not excluding profiles:

* **Requestor**

Has a need to use IT resources such as computation hardware. Those resources are purchased in the decentralized market. The actual usage of the resources is backed by the Golem decentralized infrastructure.  

* **Provider**

Has free IT resources that can be shared with other actors in the network. Those resources are sold in the decentralized market.

Both requestors and providers may be launched on different types of hardware. Those can be laptops, desktop computers, servers, and cloud environments. For the requestors, it is also feasible to be executed on mobile devices.

## How can I benefit?

There are two ways you can benefit from the Golem:

### **Develop a Golem based product**

Our decentralized stacks form a unique business value proposition your product can be based on. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Making Golem based product development being super easy is our core business.
{% endhint %}

 And there are no licensing fees. The details are described here:

### **Become a Golem provider**

If you have Internet-connected hardware that supports running Linux, you can install a Golem Network provider package, share your hardware resources, and **have a passive income stream straight to your** [**ethereum**](https://ethereum.org/) **address**. Just follow this link:

## Golem is open source

{% hint style="info" %}
The Golem is open-source software. All the code base is available under the GPL license.

## Documentation

This is Golem SDK documentation. Those documentation resources are aimed at developers working on products based on Golem.

The documentation aimed at developers working on developing Golem infrastructure codebase itself is here:
